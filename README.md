# Estimating the Effect of Timing on Coupon Effectiveness
Official implementation of "Estimating the Effect of Timing on Coupon Effectiveness". While we cannot share the data from experiments performed on the corporate data due to confidentiality reasons, we share the experiments performed on a public dataset. A portion of code was used from [a notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dilemma/uplift-test/notebook). 

## Getting the data
We download the data from [the competition web page](https://ods.ai/competitions/x5-retailhero-uplift-modeling/data), extract the csv files within, and save those csv files in a directory called "retail_hero_data/" in the root folder.
